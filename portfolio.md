### Wearable Activity Monitor
**Client:** Oregon State University VLSI Lab

**Description:** Created a running app to showcase the capabilities of a new low-power IoT device to potential investors. Combined the EKG and motion tracking properties of the device with the iPhone's GPS capabilities to create a compelling workout app similar to Nike+ Running, with added functionality from the device.
