For the past few days, Portland has been my place of residence and will continue to be for the next three months. Since being introduced to [OMSI](https://www.facebook.com/OMSI.Museum) at age five, I’ve always enjoyed visiting PDX, but my visits have only been occasional day trips. Now I’m here on a summer internship at [Jive Software](https://www.jivesoftware.com) in the heart of downtown. I left my car behind, but will pick up a road bike sometime in the coming weeks. Until then I'll be exploring the city on foot!

### the good
Something magical happens when thousands of people pursuing their dreams are crammed into a small space. To me, this is what’s so special about cities. The city of roses does it differently though. While most large cities feel frantic, Portland is almost serene. Everyone’s going about their business, they’re just not stepping on each other’s toes. Strangers talk to each other on sidewalk corners. Police drive Segways and Crown Vics painted with flowers instead of blacked-out SUVs. The whole city feels like a big park.

*Going to Powell's after work is a habit I don't see stopping anytime soon.*

### the bad
As with any city, poverty is an issue. Running by the river yesterday, I saw people curling up for the night on the sidewalk. This wasn't as visible when visiting Portland by car, but is very apparent on foot. Its my dream to someday be in a position to offer these people opportunities in the way of jobs, but in the meantime its a struggle to figure out how I can help.

### the future
I couldn't ask for a better place to live and work. Jive is full of some of the best people I've ever met and I'm excited to start building stuff with them. Portland always has something new to do or discover, I could never see it all. I will certainly try though!
