For the past 55 hours, Portland has been my place of residence and will continue to be for the next two months. Since being introduced to [OMSI](https://www.facebook.com/OMSI.Museum) at age five, I’ve always enjoyed visiting PDX, but my visits have only been occasional day trips. Now I’m here on a summer internship at [Jive Software](https://www.jivesoftware.com), right in the heart of downtown. I left my car behind, but will probably get a roadbike sometime in the coming weeks to expand my scope a bit from the three-ish miles I’m willing to walk in any given direction.

### the good
Something magical happens when thousands of people pursuing their dreams are shoved into a small space. To me, this is what’s so special about cities. Portland does it differently though. While most large cities feel frantic, Portland is almost serene. Everyone’s going about their business, they’re just not stepping on each other’s toes. Strangers talk to each other on sidewalk corners. Police drive Crown Vics painted with flowers instead of black SUVs. The whole city just feels like a big park.
