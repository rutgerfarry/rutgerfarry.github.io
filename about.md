I'm a sophomore at Oregon State University and mobile development intern at Jive Software. Previously student software lead at the [Oregon State VLSI Research Group](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/research/vlsi/).

Experiencing life is super important to me. I love running, snowboarding, and exploring near and far.

As far as development goes, I'm most excited about platforms that don't force developers to reinvent the wheel, allowing them to focus their time on real issues. As a proponent of functional programming, I enjoy developing with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). My biggest interest right now is in deep learning, which I hope to take a class in this summer while working as a mobile dev intern at [Jive Software](https://www.jivesoftware.com/).
